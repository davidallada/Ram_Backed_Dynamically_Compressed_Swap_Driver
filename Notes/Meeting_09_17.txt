Questions/Comments coming in:
How to reference other devices and access their queues?
What is the difference between registering a device with the kernel and mounting a filesystem on that device in fstab?

Answers/Comments:
-> It is not possible to simply "redirect" requests to the queue of another device in the sense that we need to create a new request
     from scratch that is effectively a duplicate with different headers that are specific to the target device.
-> Might not be a bad idea to "forget the user for now" and simply try to execute a random request to another disk in place of the user request
    until we are certain that we can get the inter device driver communication working.
-> Registration with the kernel is more of an "I exist" to the kernel but does not really do anything more than that. Once the device has been 
    registered it is necessary to mount a file system on top of that and stick it into the file system table.
-> Need to take care about the formatting of swap devices since our file system willl likely be one of swap.
-> Also need to tell the kernel which file system we want it to use for swap -> This should allow us to be "the disk" of choice.
-> Google inter-device-driver communication (seems easier said than done but w/e)
-> Might also not be a bad idea to install a character device driver first since those are a bit less tricky than block ones
-> Start off using a RAM disk (I think sbull already does this).
-> Probably not a bad idea to implement these modules seperately (assuming they can communicate properly)


Deliverables for next meeting (09/26/19):
Think about the "Why" of the project and maybe add that to the writeup.
Build the kernel
Solid progress on inter device driver communication
