# Ram_Backed_Dynamically_Compressed_Swap_Driver
This is the implementation for a RAM Backed Dynamically Compressed Swap Driver. This project was part of a Virginia Tech Fall 2019 Systems Capstone into exploring how to effectively get access to more memory in a system. The idea is to create a swap device in RAM, so hits to performance from swapping to disk is limited.
